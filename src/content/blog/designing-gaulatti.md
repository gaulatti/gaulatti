When approaching the redesign of my personal website, I found myself drawn to the timeless principles of Bauhaus design. The movement's emphasis on functionality, geometric simplicity, and bold typography perfectly aligned with my vision for a digital space that would showcase my work across software engineering, music composition, and journalism.

## Design Philosophy

The core challenge was creating a space that felt both professionally sharp and personally authentic. I wanted the site to reflect the precision of my technical work while capturing the creativity of my musical and journalistic endeavors. The solution came through three key design principles:

1. **Bold Typography & Hierarchy**: Using geometric sans-serif fonts and dramatic size contrasts to create clear visual hierarchy and immediate impact.
2. **Geometric Minimalism**: Incorporating simple shapes and primary colors as functional design elements rather than mere decoration.
3. **Purposeful Motion**: Adding subtle animations that enhance rather than distract, like the text scramble effect in the hero section.

## Technical Implementation

The technical stack needed to support both performance and maintainability. I chose Astro for its excellent static site generation capabilities and near-zero JavaScript overhead. Here's a look at some key implementation decisions:

```js
// Hero section text scramble effect
class TextScramble {
  // Implementation demonstrates the balance of
  // playful interaction and performance
}
```

The site achieves a perfect Lighthouse score while maintaining visual richnessâ€”proving that following Bauhaus principles of "form follows function" remains relevant in modern web development.

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced my belief that the best digital experiences emerge from a deep understanding of both artistic principles and technical constraints. The Bauhaus movement's integration of art, craft, and technology continues to offer valuable lessons for contemporary digital design.

What started as a personal website redesign became an exploration of how historical design principles can inform modern digital experiences. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this approach or discuss your own experiences balancing aesthetics with functionality.
